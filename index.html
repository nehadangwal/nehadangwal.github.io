Here's a thorough analysis of Neha Dangwal's LinkedIn profile:

🔍 Overall Profile Analysis: Neha Dangwal
First Impression / Headline
The headline is bold and specific: "AI Spend Auditor & Governance Strategist | Eliminating the 'AI Tax' | $17M+ Impact @ Cisco & Dell | Patent-Pending SentryNode". This is strong positioning — it leads with a problem she solves, quantified impact, and a proprietary innovation. It differentiates her immediately from generic "AI Engineer" profiles.

Brand Identity: What She's Built
Neha has crafted a clear, ownable niche: AI FinOps + Governance. The "AI Tax" concept is a memorable, marketable framing. Combined with a patent-pending product (SentryNode), white papers, a portfolio site, Substack, and GitHub repos, she presents as a thought leader + practitioner, not just a job seeker.

How the market sees this: She looks like someone building a company or consulting practice, not someone looking for a job. That's intentional and can be very compelling to the right audience — but could confuse traditional recruiters.

Credibility Anchors
✅ 9+ years at Cisco and Dell (enterprise pedigree)
✅ $17M+ ROI claim (specific and bold)
✅ Patent application #63/982,542 (verifiable, signals serious IP investment)
✅ 77.6% cost reduction + 98.2% quality parity (precise metrics signal rigor)
✅ MS in Computer Science, Binghamton University
These are strong trust signals, especially for enterprise buyers and VCs evaluating her as a founder/advisor.

What Works Really Well
The niche is timely. AI cost governance is an exploding pain point in 2025–2026. Companies are drowning in LLM spend with little visibility. She's positioned ahead of the curve.
Technical + business fluency. She speaks kernel-level sandboxing (gVisor) AND C-suite ROI in the same breath — rare and valuable.
Self-directed work signals initiative. The independent project period (March 2024–present) is framed well, showing she wasn't idle but building.
Multiple content channels (Substack, Medium, GitHub, portfolio) build authority and discoverability.
Gaps & Risks the Market May Notice
Concern	Why It Matters
Employment gap framing	March 2024–Feb 2026 is ~2 years of self-directed work. Some hiring managers will flag this; the framing as "Engineering & Product Leader (Independent)" is smart but not bulletproof.
$17M ROI attribution	Claimed across Cisco and Dell — but the profile doesn't clearly break this down. Skeptical readers may question if this is her impact or team impact. More specificity per role would help.
SentryNode traction	The patent is pending, but there's no mention of paying customers, pilots, or revenue. The "2 Design Partners for Q2 2026" language reads as pre-revenue.
Cisco/Dell recency	Her last full-time role ended Feb 2024. Titles (Senior Engineer, Platform Owner) are solid but not at the Director+ level, which some enterprise buyers of consulting services might expect.
Dense summary	The summary has strong substance but is slightly overwhelming — markdown-style symbols (#, *) left in suggest it was written for a different format and not fully cleaned up for LinkedIn.
How Different Audiences See Her
Enterprise Buyers / CTOs: "Interesting — she has real engineering chops and a credible cost-reduction framework. I'd take a call."

Recruiters (full-time roles): "Strong background, but is she looking for a job or running a startup? Hard to tell. Gap could be a red flag."

VCs / Angel Investors: "Early-stage founder with domain expertise and a patent. Worth tracking — needs to show customer traction."

Consulting Clients: "She's clearly an expert. The audit offer sounds concrete. Low risk to engage for a scoped project."

Top 3 Recommendations
Clean up the summary formatting — remove markdown symbols (#, *) that appear as plain text on LinkedIn. It undercuts an otherwise polished brand.
Add social proof to SentryNode — even one testimonial, pilot result, or named advisor would dramatically increase credibility.
Clarify the ROI breakdown — attribute the $17M more specifically (e.g., "$12M at Cisco through X initiative, $5M at Dell through Y") to make it defensible and more memorable.
Bottom line: Neha's profile is in the top tier for niche positioning and technical authority. She reads as a credible, innovative expert in an emerging and valuable space. The main market risk is ambiguity around whether she's a consultant, founder, or job seeker — tightening that narrative would unlock the right inbound opportunities much faster.

Profile (2).pdf
pdf

How about this now?

3:09 PM
The content is essentially identical to the first profile — same experience, same summary, same metrics. The only meaningful difference is formatting: the second version has the markdown symbols (#, *, bullet dashes) collapsed/removed, making the summary run together as a wall of text without spacing.

Here's how the two compare:

Profile 1 (previous) vs Profile 2 (this one)

The first profile actually reads slightly better because at least the line breaks and spacing gave some visual separation between sections in the summary. This version has the same raw markdown artifacts but without the breathing room, making the summary even harder to parse — it reads as one dense, unpunctuated block.

Bottom line: Neither version is the "clean" one. Both have the same core issue — the LinkedIn summary was likely drafted in a rich text editor or AI tool and the formatting didn't transfer cleanly to LinkedIn's plain text field. The # symbols and run-together sentences in the summary are still present here.

The substantive analysis from before still applies in full. The priority fix remains the same: rewrite the summary natively in LinkedIn's editor (not copy-pasted from elsewhere) so it renders with proper spacing and no stray symbols. The underlying content and positioning are genuinely strong — the formatting is just undermining a well-built brand.

are there any challenges which I shoudk be awre of while someone see's my profile:

3:29 PM
Yes — and this version is actually the cleanest of the three so the experience sections read much better. Here are the specific challenges to be aware of:

🔴 Critical Issues

1. The Summary is still broken The # symbol and run-together text in the summary (today.# The Solution:, parity.My Architectural Pillars:, I offer:AI Spend Audits:) is the single biggest problem. It's the first thing people read and it signals either carelessness or copy-paste from an AI tool — which is ironic given your positioning as a technical governance expert. It chips away at credibility before someone even reaches your impressive experience section.

2. Employment gap ambiguity February 2024 → February 2026 is two full years without a traditional employer. You've structured it as "Self-Directed Projects" which is smart, but recruiters and enterprise buyers will still mentally flag it. The problem is there's no external validator — no client names, no testimonials, no press mention, nothing to anchor that the work was real and recognized beyond your own GitHub.

3. SentryNode has no traction signals "Accepting 2 Design Partners for Q2 2026" reads as pre-revenue and pre-customer. A patent pending is promising but patents get filed before anything is validated. Without at least one named pilot, a waitlist number, or a quote from someone who used it, the market reads this as an idea, not a product.

🟡 Medium Concerns

4. The $17M ROI claim is unattributed It's in the headline and summary but never broken down in the experience section. Sophisticated readers — VCs, enterprise buyers, senior recruiters — will wonder: is this her impact or her team's? Was this revenue generated, cost saved, or value estimated? Vague large numbers without context can backfire and seem inflated.

5. Title progression is flat She went from Senior Software Engineer at Dell → Senior Software Engineer & Platform Product Owner at Cisco. That's lateral, not upward. For someone claiming $17M impact and founding-level work, the absence of a Staff Engineer, Principal, or Director title in her corporate history creates a quiet credibility gap for people who read carefully.

6. Certifications are entry-level for the positioning "AI for Everyone (Andrew Ng)" and Coursera's Generative AI specialization are beginner-to-intermediate credentials. For someone positioning as a governance architect and patent holder, these certs can actually undermine the brand — they signal she's catching up on AI fundamentals rather than operating at the frontier. Consider either removing them or replacing with more advanced credentials.

🟢 Minor but Worth Fixing

7. "You Inspire" award listed twice — looks like a data error, which again subtly signals carelessness.

8. The intern role at Dell (2015) — 4 months from 10 years ago adds very little at this career stage and takes up space that could reinforce current positioning.

9. No recommendations — For a consultant asking enterprises to trust her with LLM spend, zero LinkedIn recommendations is a quiet red flag. Even 2–3 strong ones from Cisco/Dell colleagues would help enormously.

The Single Most Important Fix

Rewrite the summary directly in LinkedIn's editor — not copy-pasted. That one change removes the # artifact, fixes the run-together sentences, and immediately makes the whole profile feel polished and trustworthy. Everything else is secondary to that.

Would you like me to draft a clean version of the summary you can paste directly?

sure, let's do it

3:31 PM
Here's a clean, LinkedIn-optimized summary you can copy directly into LinkedIn's "About" section — type or paste it directly into LinkedIn's editor, not from a Word doc or external tool:

I bridge the gap between frontier AI capabilities and enterprise-grade fiscal reality.

After 9+ years at Cisco and Dell — delivering $17M+ in measurable ROI across platforms used by hundreds of engineers — I kept seeing the same pattern: brilliant AI infrastructure scaling faster than its governance. That gap has a cost. I call it the AI Tax.

The Solution: SentryNode Gateway (U.S. Patent Pending #63/982,542)

SentryNode is a governed AI gateway I architected to eliminate the AI Tax at its source. Validated results: 77.6% LLM cost reduction via Adaptive Inference Routing, with 98.2% quality parity maintained.

Built on three pillars:
→ Sovereign Engine: HMAC-SHA256 cryptographic provenance
→ Hardened Execution: Zero-binary containerization + gVisor/runsc sandboxing
→ Semantic Circuit Breakers: Sub-second agentic loop interception via Redis-backed state matching

How I Help — Consulting & Partnerships

I work with engineering teams hitting a fiscal wall with agentic OpEx. Currently accepting 2 Design Partners for Q2 2026.

What I offer:
→ AI Spend Audits — identifying 20–50% "ghost spend" in your LLM usage logs
→ Governance Strategy — semantic guardrails to stop recursive agentic loops
→ Adaptive Inference Roadmaps — transitioning routine tasks to cost-effective SLMs

A few tips when pasting this:

Use LinkedIn's editor directly and type the → arrows manually (or copy from here one section at a time)
The bold formatting won't transfer from here — use LinkedIn's own bold button to bold the three section headers after pasting

Next Steps for Optimization
The profile is exceptionally strong. To maximize your "Consultant" flow, you might consider:

Turning on LinkedIn Service Pages: If you haven't, list "AI Consulting" and "Software Development" as services you provide.
Call to Action: Ensure your "About" section concludes with a clear next step, such as "DM me 'AUDIT' to start

Great additions! Here's the updated summary with both enhancements woven in naturally:

Ready to stop paying the AI Tax? DM me "AUDIT" and let's identify where your LLM spend is leaking.

Why this closing works:

The "DM me AUDIT" call to action does three things at once — it filters for serious prospects, creates a low-friction entry point, and makes it easy for Neha to track inbound interest. It's a technique used by top LinkedIn consultants and coaches precisely because it converts passive profile viewers into active conversations.

One additional reminder: After updating your About section, go to your LinkedIn profile's Services tab and add "AI Consulting" and "LLM Governance" as offered services. This activates LinkedIn's Service Pages feature, which surfaces your profile in searches from people actively looking to hire consultants — a completely separate discovery channel from regular profile views.

let's write description :
About
Description

3:53 PM
Here's a crisp, powerful description for the LinkedIn Services "About" section:

I help engineering and finance leaders eliminate the hidden costs of ungoverned AI infrastructure — what I call the AI Tax.

With 9+ years at Cisco and Dell delivering $17M+ in enterprise ROI, I bring both the technical depth and business fluency to audit your LLM spend, implement governance guardrails, and build adaptive inference strategies that cut costs by 20–50% without sacrificing quality.

My proprietary framework, SentryNode Gateway (U.S. Patent Pending #63/982,542), has validated a 77.6% reduction in LLM OpEx with 98.2% quality parity.

I currently offer: → AI Spend Audits → LLM Governance Strategy → Adaptive Inference Roadmaps

Currently accepting 2 Design Partners for Q2 2026.

📩 DM me "AUDIT" to get started.

Why this works for the Services section specifically:

LinkedIn's Services page is searched by buyers, not recruiters — so this description skips the career narrative entirely and speaks directly to pain points and outcomes. The patent reference adds instant credibility, the "2 Design Partners" creates scarcity, and the DM call to action gives buyers a frictionless next step.

Character note: LinkedIn's Services description allows up to 500 characters in some views — if it truncates, prioritize keeping the first two paragraphs and the CTA, and trim the middle.

within 500 characters please

3:53 PM
Here's the 500-character version:

I help engineering leaders eliminate the AI Tax — hidden costs of ungoverned LLM infrastructure.

9+ years at Cisco & Dell. $17M+ ROI delivered. Patent-pending SentryNode Gateway validates 77.6% LLM cost reduction with 98.2% quality parity.

I offer:
→ AI Spend Audits
→ LLM Governance Strategy
→ Adaptive Inference Roadmaps

2 Design Partner spots open for Q2 2026.

📩 DM "AUDIT" to start.

That lands at approximately 470 characters — just under the limit with a little breathing room. Clean, punchy, and buyer-focused.

3:54 PM
Yes, these settings are spot on for your positioning. Here's the quick rationale for each:

Work Location ✅ Checking both San Francisco Bay Area AND remote is smart. Bay Area adds local credibility and signals you're embedded in the AI/tech hub. Remote opens you to enterprise clients globally — which is where your real market is.

Pricing → "Contact for pricing" ✅ This is the right call for consulting at your level. A starting hourly rate would:

Anchor you too low if set conservatively
Scare off smaller clients if set at your true value
Commoditize work that is highly contextual
"Contact for pricing" positions you as a premium, scoped-engagement consultant — not a freelancer on a marketplace.

Messages → Allow Open Profile ✅ Turn this on, absolutely. Your entire CTA strategy ("DM me AUDIT") falls apart if people can't message you without being connected first. Open Profile removes that friction entirely and is essential for inbound consulting leads.

One additional setting to check while you're there:

Go to Creator Mode if it's not already on. It changes your profile's follow button to be more prominent than "Connect," which is better for thought leaders and consultants building an audience around the AI Tax narrative.

Everything looks dialed in — you're set up correctly for a consulting flow.

but creater mode will keep. e away from who is viewing my profile

3:55 PM
You're absolutely right to flag that — it's a real tradeoff:

Creator Mode OFF (your current instinct)

✅ You can see Who Viewed Your Profile fully
✅ Better for active prospecting — you can identify and reach out to people checking you out
✅ Better for sales intelligence — knowing a CTO from a target company viewed you is valuable signal
❌ "Follow" button is less prominent
Creator Mode ON

✅ "Follow" button replaces "Connect" — better for audience building
✅ Content gets slightly wider algorithmic distribution
❌ You lose visibility into who viewed your profile unless they're 1st connections
❌ Less useful when you're in active consulting outreach mode
My recommendation for your situation:

Keep Creator Mode OFF for now.

Here's why — you're not trying to build a mass audience right now. You're targeting a very specific buyer: CTOs and engineering leaders hitting a fiscal wall with AI spend. That's a high-value, low-volume sales motion. Knowing exactly who is viewing your profile and following up is worth far more than a slightly more prominent Follow button.

Turn Creator Mode on after you've landed your first 2 Design Partners and shift into audience-building mode.

Let's write a post for Linkedin notifuying about Ai consulting services? shaould I also be yargeting group which can help me getting more traction for tier 1 consulting offeres?

3:56 PM
Great two-part question. Let me tackle both:

📝 LinkedIn Post Draft
I've spent 9 years watching enterprises build brilliant AI infrastructure.

And then watch it silently drain their budgets.

There's a name for this: The AI Tax.

It shows up as:
→ Recursive agentic loops running unchecked
→ Frontier models doing jobs a smaller model could handle
→ "Ghost spend" — LLM costs with zero business output

At Cisco and Dell, I helped engineer platforms serving millions of devices. I saw firsthand how fast ungoverned AI scales — and how invisible the damage is until it hits the P&L.

So I built the solution.

SentryNode Gateway (U.S. Patent Pending #63/982,542) is a governed AI gateway that has validated: → 77.6% reduction in LLM OpEx → 98.2% quality parity maintained

I'm now opening 2 Design Partner spots for Q2 2026 for engineering teams ready to audit and govern their AI spend.

How to reply sadie .midst of buildng sentryynode and woerkinh part time on consulting work:
Hi Neha,
I assume you're not actively looking, but smart people tend to know other smart people, and most likely you know someone very good who is quietly open to the right opportunity. They are hiring for Product Engineers(60FE/40BE), Backend Engineers and AI Engineers.
I'm working with four standout companies right now. Two are Series A with Series B rounds already lined up, but may not even pull the trigger given how capital-efficient and profitable they've become. The other two are strong Series B companies compounding fast. All are still firmly in 0?1 and 1?10 mode, this is real building, not maintenance engineering.
Comp & scope (consistent across roles):
* Total comp: up to $450K (based on experience) + 0.2–0.5% equity
* Level: open from 3+ YOE through Staff / Lead
* Small, highly collaborative teams with tight product + design + eng loops
* High ownership, minimal process, fast iteration
The companies (all SF, hypergrowth):
* Series A (~$30M raised, ~50 employees) - operating in a ~$300B market still dominated by legacy systems; modernizing core workflows with strong mid-market and enterprise pull; ~$26–30M ARR run-rate, ~2.5× YoY.
* Series A (~$20M raised, ~70 employees) - healthcare / bio automation replacing deeply manual, error-prone processes; accelerating expansion across existing customers; ~$18–22M ARR run-rate.
* Series B (~$80M raised, ~75 employees) - healthcare platform serving ~100M end customers, scaling mission-critical systems at real user scale; ~$50–60M ARR run-rate.
* Series B (~$100M raised, ~125 employees) - targeting a ~$650B market that's barely been disrupted; first credible modern platform in the category with clear breakout traction; ~$70–85M ARR run-rate.
Roles I'm actively hiring for (IC, high ownership):
* Frontend Product Engineer - TypeScript, React/Next.js; strong product instincts, performance-aware, UX-minded.
* Backend Product Engineer (heavy BE) - core APIs, systems, data models, and business logic; deeply product-driven backend work (no AI required).
* Agentic AI Engineer - production agents, orchestration, retrieval, evals, and reliability; focused on shipping workflows, not demos.

Here's a reply that's warm, professional, and keeps the door open without compromising your current focus:


A
Refer & Stay Visible

B
Warm No + Plant a Seed
Hi Sadie,

Really appreciate the outreach — and the quality of the brief. You've clearly done your homework on the companies.

I'm currently heads-down building SentryNode Gateway (AI governance infrastructure, patent pending) and taking on a couple of consulting design partners for Q2 — so a full-time role isn't the right fit right now.

That said, the Agentic AI Engineer profile you're hiring for is squarely in my world. If any of these companies are also dealing with ungoverned LLM spend or agentic loop costs, I'd genuinely be open to a consulting conversation — that's a faster path to impact than hiring.

I'll flag any strong engineers I come across for the IC roles.

Best,
Neha
Which to choose:

Option 1 (Refer & Stay Visible) — Use this if you want to keep it simple, stay on Sadie's radar for future opportunities, and not complicate the message with a consulting pitch.

Option 2 (Warm No + Plant a Seed) — Use this if you want to subtly open a consulting door with the Series A/B companies themselves. The line "faster path to impact than hiring" is a genuine value proposition — agentic AI companies at that stage are almost certainly bleeding LLM spend.

Option 2 has higher upside but requires Sadie to forward the idea internally. Option 1 is safer and keeps the relationship warm for the long game.

why did sadie erached out although I am not in the mmarket for fuull timw?

9:37 PM
Great observation — and it tells you something important. A few reasons why Sadie reached out despite your profile signaling consulting/founder mode:

1. Recruiters Play Probability, Not Certainty Sadie's opening line gives it away: "I assume you're not actively looking, but smart people know smart people." This is a standard recruiter hedge — she's not necessarily targeting you as a candidate. She's fishing for referrals as much as direct hires. One message, two possible wins.

2. Your Profile Sends Mixed Signals This is the more important insight. Despite your consulting positioning, your profile still reads partially as a senior IC engineer to a recruiter's eye because:

Your last employer title was Senior Software Engineer
You have no "Open to Work" off, but also no clear "Not Available" signal
"Self-Directed Projects" can look like a gap to ATS systems and recruiters skimming fast
You don't explicitly say anywhere "I am not open to full-time roles"
3. The Agentic AI Engineer Role is a Very Specific Match Your SentryNode work — production agents, orchestration, governance — maps almost perfectly to what she's hiring for. That specificity likely triggered her outreach.

What This Tells You Strategically

Your profile is still attracting the wrong inbound. Recruiters instead of consulting clients. To fix this, consider adding one line to your headline or summary:

"Not open to full-time roles — available for consulting engagements only"

That single line filters out recruiter noise and signals confidence to consulting buyers — people who want someone exclusive, not someone job hunting.

Profile (2).pdf
pdf

okay, does my profile still is giving mixed signals:

9:40 PM
Yes, unfortunately it still is. Here's exactly where the mixed signals are coming from in this latest version:

🔴 Still Sending Mixed Signals

1. The Summary still has formatting artifacts ✍# appears before "The AI Tax Manifesto" link — another stray character that signals copy-paste. Small but visible.

2. No explicit "not open to full-time" statement Anywhere on the profile. This is the single biggest fix needed right now. Without it, every recruiter with a strong AI role will message you. Add this to your headline:

"Consulting Only | Not Open to Full-Time"

or as the last line of your summary:

"Note: I am exclusively available for consulting engagements. Not open to full-time roles."

3. "Self-Directed Projects" title still reads as a gap Recruiters skim. "Self-Directed Projects" as a company name doesn't register as a real business. Compare:

What it says	What recruiters read
Self-Directed Projects	Unemployed, doing side projects
SentryNode Gateway (Founder)	Building a company
Fix: Remove the "Self-Directed Projects" entry entirely and fold everything under SentryNode Gateway as your current company. You're already listing SentryNode as a separate role — just consolidate.

4. Two separate SentryNode entries create confusion You have:

SentryNode Gateway — AI Spend Auditor & Governance Strategist (Feb 2026)
Self-Directed Projects — Engineering & Product Leader (March 2024)
A visitor sees two different entries and gets confused about what you actually do and when you started. It should be one clean entry:

SentryNode Gateway | Founder & AI Governance Architect March 2024 – Present

5. The intern role is still there Dell Enterprise Service Group, 4 months in 2015. At this career stage and with this positioning it actively dilutes the profile. Remove it.

6. "You Inspire" award listed twice Still there, still looks like a data error.

The 5-Minute Fixes That Change Everything:

Add "Consulting Only" to your headline
Add "Not open to full-time roles" as the last line of your summary
Merge the two SentryNode entries into one starting March 2024
Delete the 2015 intern role
Fix the ✍# artifact in the summary
Do those five things and the mixed signals disappear almost entirely. Want me to rewrite the headline with the consulting-only signal built in?

Let's check if portfolio looks good?

9:49 PM
Let me render this and take a look at it properly.


Created a file, read a file
Created a file, read a file
The portfolio is visually strong — dark hero, clean stat cards, good hierarchy. Here's the full honest assessment:

✅ What Works Well
Design & Visual — the dark navy header with cyan accents is professional and modern. The floating stat cards ($17M+, 77.6%, Patent Pending) create an immediate strong first impression. SentryNode section is well structured with the three pillar cards.

The Design Partner CTA section (dark cyan block) is excellent — specific, actionable, with the Tally form link.

🔴 Issues to Fix
1. Date inconsistency — biggest credibility risk The Design Partner section says "Q1 2026" but your LinkedIn and everywhere else says "Q2 2026." A prospect visiting from LinkedIn will notice this immediately. Fix to Q2 2026.

2. Missing a "Consulting Only" signal Just like LinkedIn, the portfolio doesn't say you're not open to full-time roles. Add one line in the header: "Available for consulting engagements · Not open to full-time roles"

3. No contact/booking CTA in the header The most important action — reaching out to hire you — requires scrolling all the way down. Add a "Book a Call" or "DM AUDIT" button right in the hero section.

4. "Low-Level Systems" placeholder card looks unfinished The greyed-out dashed card with "Legacy Research" reads as incomplete work. Either fill it with a real project or remove it entirely.

5. Footer is missing Substack You have a Substack (nehadangwal.substack.com) which is part of your thought leadership — it should be in the footer links.

🟡 Minor Suggestions
The quote in the header box ("I lead by aligning technical sovereignty...") is a bit abstract for a buyer-first portfolio — consider replacing with a concrete outcome statement
"250+ Engineers Led" stat card — this number doesn't appear anywhere in your LinkedIn profile, so it may raise questions if someone cross-references
Overall it's a B+ portfolio — very close to excellent. The Q1/Q2 date fix is urgent. Everything else is polish.

Here's the fully rebuilt portfolio. Every issue from the audit has been fixed:

What changed:

✅ Q1 → Q2 2026 corrected throughout
✅ "Consulting Only · Not Open to Full-Time Roles" badge added prominently in the hero
✅ "DM AUDIT" CTA button in the header — no scrolling required
✅ Placeholder "Legacy Research" card removed — replaced with SentryNode as its own project card
✅ Substack added to nav and footer
✅ "250+ Engineers Led" stat removed — replaced with verifiable numbers from your actual profile
✅ Full enterprise detail from both Cisco and Dell now visible in the impact section
Design upgrades: Dark, technical aesthetic with Syne + DM Sans typography, noise texture overlay, radial glow effects, animated hero entry, and hover interactions — feels like a serious founder's portfolio, not a resume page.

Complete redesign — calm, editorial, and professional. The approach this time:

Design direction: Warm off-white background, forest green accent, Instrument Serif for headings paired with Geist for body — feels like a high-end consulting firm card, not a tech portfolio.

What's on the single page, in order:

Top nav bar with links
Hero with the "AI Tax" hook + consulting-only badge + CTA
3-stat strip ($17M / 77.6% / 98.2%)
SentryNode card with pillars
4 services in a clean 2×2 grid
Experience timeline (3 roles only — clean)
Dark Design Partner CTA block
Footer
Everything fits without scrolling feeling overwhelming — it breathes. Would you like any copy or layout tweaks?
